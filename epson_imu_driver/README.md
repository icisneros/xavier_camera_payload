# README for Epson IMU Driver for ROS

## What is this repository for?

* This code provides interface between Epson IMU (current default=G365PDF0 or G320/G354/G364/G370/V340) and ROS.

* The epson_imu_driver_node.cpp is the C++ wrapper used to communicate with ROS

* The other source files in src/ are based on the C driver released by Epson:
  [Epson IMU UART-only Linux User-space Driver Example](https://vdc.epson.com/imu-products/imu-inertial-measurement-units)

## How do I use the driver?

1. Place the source files in its own directory in your catkin workspace src/ folder.
   Modify the CMakeLists.txt in this package to select the IMU model in the add_definitions -D macro assignment for gcc in Line 125
   - For example, "-DV340" for M-V340 
   - For example, "-DG364PDC0" for M-G364PDC0
   
2. Run "catkin_make" at the root of your catkin workspace to build or rebuild the driver after making any changes to
   the CMakeLists.txt or any of the .c or .cpp or .h source files.
   - NOTE: It is recommended to configure the parameters in the launch file, if possible, instead of modifying the source files directly

3. Modify the appropriate launch file in the launch/ folder to set your desired IMU environment and configure parameter options:
   - *serial port* in Line 7
   - *dout_rate* in Line 61
   - *filter_sel* in Line 95
   - "publisher topic" in Line 138 etc...

4. Run the appropriate launch file:
   i.e.
```   
roslaunch epson_imu_driver epson_g365.launch
```
   - The launch file contains parameters for configuring:
     - the type of data to output from the IMU
     - the update rate, etc. 
   - All parameters are described in the launch file.

*NOTE:*

When using G365 with *attitude output / quaternion orientation*, the X, Y, Z axis designation will differ from the labelling on the IMU marking.
This is necessary to adhere to ROS axis convention as defined ROS REP103.

IMU Marking   | ROS Orientation
------------- | ---------------
Y+            | X+ (Roll)
X-            | Y+ (Pitch)
Z+            | Z+ (Yaw)
