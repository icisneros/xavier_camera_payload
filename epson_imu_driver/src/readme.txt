Test machine:
--------------
  UART Interface,
    Ubuntu 14 running in Oracle VirtualBox on Core i7 Win 8.1 PC
    Raspberry Pi 2 Model B v1.1 (with Epson IMU USB evalboard)
    Raspberry Pi Model B+ v1.2 (with Epson IMU USB evalboard)

Requirements:
--------------
  For using IMU UART interface, this should work on any generic unix (POSIX) serial port with gcc

Important for UART Interface:
-----------------------------
1. The application assumes that the Epson IMU is connected to serial tty (UART) either through USB evaluation board or
   directly to the UART port on an embedded system:

    Edit the source files:
    Specify the proper serial port on host system:
        const char *IMUSERIAL = "/dev/ttyxxx";
    Specify the # of samples to capture in main_csvlogger.c or main_screen.c:
        const unsigned int NUM_SAMPLES = xxxx;

    Compile the application:
        A. Run "make" specifying the <target> with "MODEL=" parameter.
           Supported <target> options are:
                screen or
                csvlogger or
                regdump or
                all
           Supported "MODEL=" parameters are:
                G354
                G364PDC0
                G364PDCA
                G365PDC0
                G365PDF0
                G370PDC0
                G370PDF0
                G325PDF0
                G320
                V340
           If "MODEL=" is not specified then it assumes MODEL=G354
           For example:
                make screen MODEL=G320
                or
                make csvlogger MODEL=V340
                or
                make regdump MODEL=G364PDC0
                or
                make clean  <-- recommended before creating new builds
        C. The executable will be in the found in the same folder as the Makefile and source files.

NOTE: Modify the EpsonOptions struct and configure sensor configuration settings in main() function in main_xxxx.c

NOTE: Any references to GPIO interface are placeholders and currently do nothing.
      The end user is required to connect the low level code to these functions to make use of them.

NOTE: Any references to SPI interface is not relevant for this package. The source code is shared with a common 
      code base so references to SPI interface can be ignored.

How to run the program:
-----------------------
1. Run the executable from console (may require root access to execute if regular user can not access TTY)
   sudo ./<exe filename>

2. The default csvlogger program creates CSV log of sensor data in a processed scaled log file for 1000 samples:
       Output date rate = 125 Hz (For all other models)
       Filter Tap = Moving Average TAP16/TAP32 (For all other models)

       Output = For G365PDC0/G365PDF0/G325PDF0 is 32-bit Gyro X,Y,Z Accel X,Y,Z Roll,Pitch,Yaw ResetCounter Checksum
                For G354/G364PDCA/G364PDC0/G320/G370PDC0/G370PDF0 is 32-bit Gyro X,Y,Z Accel X,Y,Z ResetCounter Checksum
                For V340 is 16-bit Gyro X,Y,Z Accel X,Y,Z Sample Counter
